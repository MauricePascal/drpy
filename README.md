## Installation

DiscordRobotsAPI for Python needs the following packages installed:  
	- Json (already in Python3.7)  
	- Requests (already in Python3.7)  
	- Logging (already in Python3.7)  
  
To install DiscordRobotsAPI for Python itself you should use pip:

```sh
$ python3 -m pip install discordrobotsapi
```

or 

```sh
$ pip install discordrobotsapi
```



## Getting Started

So, first of all, you need to import and create an discordrobotsapi object to use all functions!

```py
from discordrobotsapi.drpy import DiscordRobots

TOKEN = "The Bot Token that your Bot currently has"

api = DiscordRobots()
api.connect(TOKEN)
```

If you run this and nothing is printed in your console then everything is fine!
